  "come on, get out, work out some more, babe",
  "if all that's left is ash just let it burn",
  "the path that leads to you comes with a cool breeze and dazzling, clear sunlight",
  "that's a waste of time. no pain, no gain? disagree",
  "I wish for no more nights crying alone. I wish everything would just go right.",
  "I was far away from behaving like somebody that is fine",
  "even your smile, calm like the sea, I want to look at it every day",
  "don't abandon me. I have nothing when I erase you.",
  "I'm not strong enough to hold you the way I once did",
  "our today is like the last summer. memories that won't come back",
  "and so it is. the problem is with me. I'm the one who needs to go.",
  "let's burn our whole bodies for the last season, so there's no trace of regret left",
  "everything has started to disappear",
  "this is how my world became perfect because of you",
  "it's all over, without a word. all the painful memories.",
  "even if my vision blurs, there\u2019s no hesitation now",
  "what if I disappear, just like this? what if I evaporate into the sky? without even a single thought, let's sing today's song",
  "can I go back to a small airship that's out of orbit and lost its signal?",
  "but never forget, even in the hopeless abyss, we can do things different. we can do it our way, our own way",
  "we are playing a new sound. at last, here we are, you and I.",
  "when today is over, after that shining moment, where should I go?"
