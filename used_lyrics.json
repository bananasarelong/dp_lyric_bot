  "so don't you wanna save me",
  "in this vast universe, where is the place for me to rest?",
  "come on, get out, work out some more, babe",
  "I know I've forgotten, even promises we've made and the effort you put in",
  "I'm floating endlessly, my heavy eyes are falling asleep",
  "I was far away from behaving like somebody that is fine",
  "our today is like the last summer. memories that won't come back",
  "I know we loved somehow, but I'm never going back",
  "don't know what to do when I'm like this",
  "when today is over, after that shining moment, where should I go?",
  "can I go back to a small airship that's out of orbit and lost its signal?",
  "where are you? the one who will shine light on my darkness",
  "the path that leads to you comes with a cool breeze and dazzling, clear sunlight",
  "if all that's left is ash just let it burn",
  "and so it is. the problem is with me. I'm the one who needs to go.",
  "you gotta chase nobody",
  "everything has started to disappear",
  "I wish for no more nights crying alone. I wish everything would just go right.",
  "we are playing a new sound. at last, here we are, you and I.",
  "don't abandon me. I have nothing when I erase you.",
  "that's a waste of time. no pain, no gain? disagree",
  "what if I disappear, just like this? what if I evaporate into the sky? without even a single thought, let's sing today's song",
  "memories I've built up until now flash by. can I pour them all out here now?",
  "even your smile, calm like the sea, I want to look at it every day",
  "it's all over, without a word. all the painful memories.",
  "let's burn our whole bodies for the last season, so there's no trace of regret left",
  "only honest people suffer here, that's the world we live in",
  "dancing a hot dance on heated sand, our youthful days that won\u2019t stop",
  "I said that I wanted to do well, but nothing ever goes my way, I guess",
  "where are you? the one who will embrace my weary self?",
  "I don't want to miss you like this",
  "oh you, you have a story that only I know",
  "but never forget, even in the hopeless abyss, we can do things different. we can do it our way, our own way",
  "are you really throwing yourself away for people who aren\u2019t even blood?",
  "even if my vision blurs, there\u2019s no hesitation now",
  "I'll go back to what it was like without you",
  "I'm not strong enough to hold you the way I once did",
  "this is how my world became perfect because of you",
  "baby, please don't cry tonight"
