  "so don't you wanna save me",
  "in this vast universe, where is the place for me to rest?",
  "come on, get out, work out some more, babe",
  "I know I've forgotten, even promises we've made and the effort you put in",
  "I'm floating endlessly, my heavy eyes are falling asleep",
  "I was far away from behaving like somebody that is fine",
  "our today is like the last summer. memories that won't come back",
  "I know we loved somehow, but I'm never going back",
  "don't know what to do when I'm like this",
  "when today is over, after that shining moment, where should I go?",
  "can I go back to a small airship that's out of orbit and lost its signal?",
  "where are you? the one who will shine light on my darkness",
  "the path that leads to you comes with a cool breeze and dazzling, clear sunlight",
  "if all that's left is ash just let it burn",
  "and so it is. the problem is with me. I'm the one who needs to go.",
  "you gotta chase nobody",
  "everything has started to disappear",
  "I wish for no more nights crying alone. I wish everything would just go right.",
  "we are playing a new sound. at last, here we are, you and I.",
  "don't abandon me. I have nothing when I erase you.",
  "that's a waste of time. no pain, no gain? disagree",
  "what if I disappear, just like this? what if I evaporate into the sky? without even a single thought, let's sing today's song"
