  "our today is like the last summer. memories that won't come back",
  "but never forget, even in the hopeless abyss, we can do things different. we can do it our way, our own way",
  "dancing a hot dance on heated sand, our youthful days that won\u2019t stop",
  "where are you? the one who will embrace my weary self?"
