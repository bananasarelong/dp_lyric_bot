  "oh you, you have a story that only I know",
  "I said that I wanted to do well, but nothing ever goes my way, I guess",
  "we are playing a new sound. at last, here we are, you and I.",
  "what if I disappear, just like this? what if I evaporate into the sky? without even a single thought, let's sing today's song",
  "so don't you wanna save me",
  "this is how my world became perfect because of you",
  "if all that's left is ash just let it burn",
  "only honest people suffer here, that's the world we live in",
  "it's all over, without a word. all the painful memories.",
  "memories I've built up until now flash by. can I pour them all out here now?",
  "I was far away from behaving like somebody that is fine",
  "I'm not strong enough to hold you the way I once did",
  "but never forget, even in the hopeless abyss, we can do things different. we can do it our way, our own way",
  "and so it is. the problem is with me. I'm the one who needs to go.",
  "come on, get out, work out some more, babe",
  "I'll go back to what it was like without you",
  "even if my vision blurs, there\u2019s no hesitation now",
  "the path that leads to you comes with a cool breeze and dazzling, clear sunlight",
  "I wish for no more nights crying alone. I wish everything would just go right.",
  "that's a waste of time. no pain, no gain? disagree",
  "I know I've forgotten, even promises we've made and the effort you put in",
  "even your smile, calm like the sea, I want to look at it every day",
  "don't know what to do when I'm like this",
  "the red light turns on, and everyone holds their breath",
  "I know we loved somehow, but I'm never going back",
  "are you really throwing yourself away for people who aren\u2019t even blood?",
  "baby, please don't cry tonight"
