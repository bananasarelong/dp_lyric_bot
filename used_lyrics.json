  "we are playing a new sound. at last, here we are, you and I.",
  "oh you, you have a story that only I know",
  "I'm floating endlessly, my heavy eyes are falling asleep",
  "in this vast universe, where is the place for me to rest?",
  "can I go back to a small airship that's out of orbit and lost its signal?",
  "come on, get out, work out some more, babe",
  "but never forget, even in the hopeless abyss, we can do things different. we can do it our way, our own way",
  "I don't want to miss you like this",
  "don't know what to do when I'm like this",
  "only honest people suffer here, that's the world we live in",
  "when today is over, after that shining moment, where should I go?",
  "so don't you wanna save me",
  "let's burn our whole bodies for the last season, so there's no trace of regret left",
  "that's a waste of time. no pain, no gain? disagree",
  "what if I disappear, just like this? what if I evaporate into the sky? without even a single thought, let's sing today's song",
  "I'll go back to what it was like without you",
  "the path that leads to you comes with a cool breeze and dazzling, clear sunlight",
  "you gotta chase nobody",
  "our today is like the last summer. memories that won't come back",
  "everything has started to disappear",
  "are you really throwing yourself away for people who aren\u2019t even blood?"
