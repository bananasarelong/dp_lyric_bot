  "I'm floating endlessly, my heavy eyes are falling asleep",
  "in this vast universe, where is the place for me to rest?",
  "I know we loved somehow, but I'm never going back",
  "I'm not strong enough to hold you the way I once did",
  "so don't you wanna save me",
  "memories I've built up until now flash by. can I pour them all out here now?",
  "where are you? the one who will shine light on my darkness",
  "don't abandon me. I have nothing when I erase you.",
  "if all that's left is ash just let it burn",
  "our today is like the last summer. memories that won't come back",
  "only honest people suffer here, that's the world we live in",
  "we are playing a new sound. at last, here we are, you and I.",
  "I was far away from behaving like somebody that is fine",
  "I know I've forgotten, even promises we've made and the effort you put in",
  "I wish for no more nights crying alone. I wish everything would just go right.",
  "everything has started to disappear",
  "I'll go back to what it was like without you",
  "come on, get out, work out some more, babe"
