  "come on, get out, work out some more, babe",
  "if all that's left is ash just let it burn",
  "the path that leads to you comes with a cool breeze and dazzling, clear sunlight",
  "that's a waste of time. no pain, no gain? disagree",
  "I wish for no more nights crying alone. I wish everything would just go right.",
  "I was far away from behaving like somebody that is fine",
  "even your smile, calm like the sea, I want to look at it every day",
  "don't abandon me. I have nothing when I erase you.",
  "I'm not strong enough to hold you the way I once did",
  "our today is like the last summer. memories that won't come back",
  "and so it is. the problem is with me. I'm the one who needs to go."
