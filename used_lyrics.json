  "the path that leads to you comes with a cool breeze and dazzling, clear sunlight",
  "I'm floating endlessly, my heavy eyes are falling asleep",
  "it's all over, without a word. all the painful memories.",
  "I was far away from behaving like somebody that is fine",
  "in this vast universe, where is the place for me to rest?",
  "where are you? the one who will shine light on my darkness",
  "and so it is. the problem is with me. I'm the one who needs to go.",
  "everything has started to disappear",
  "we are playing a new sound. at last, here we are, you and I.",
  "baby, please don't cry tonight",
  "I don't want to miss you like this",
  "I know I've forgotten, even promises we've made and the effort you put in",
  "oh you, you have a story that only I know",
  "the red light turns on, and everyone holds their breath",
  "don't know what to do when I'm like this",
  "even if my vision blurs, there\u2019s no hesitation now",
  "come on, get out, work out some more, babe",
  "you gotta chase nobody",
  "but never forget, even in the hopeless abyss, we can do things different. we can do it our way, our own way",
  "even your smile, calm like the sea, I want to look at it every day",
  "when today is over, after that shining moment, where should I go?",
  "dancing a hot dance on heated sand, our youthful days that won\u2019t stop",
  "can I go back to a small airship that's out of orbit and lost its signal?",
  "so don't you wanna save me",
  "where are you? the one who will embrace my weary self?",
  "what if I disappear, just like this? what if I evaporate into the sky? without even a single thought, let's sing today's song",
  "are you really throwing yourself away for people who aren\u2019t even blood?",
  "I wish for no more nights crying alone. I wish everything would just go right.",
  "if all that's left is ash just let it burn",
  "I know we loved somehow, but I'm never going back",
  "don't abandon me. I have nothing when I erase you.",
  "that's a waste of time. no pain, no gain? disagree"
