  "are you really throwing yourself away for people who aren\u2019t even blood?",
  "what if I disappear, just like this? what if I evaporate into the sky? without even a single thought, let's sing today's song",
  "our today is like the last summer. memories that won't come back",
  "so don't you wanna save me",
  "if all that's left is ash just let it burn",
  "I'm not strong enough to hold you the way I once did",
  "only honest people suffer here, that's the world we live in",
  "even your smile, calm like the sea, I want to look at it every day",
  "memories I've built up until now flash by. can I pour them all out here now?",
  "baby, please don't cry tonight",
  "I know I've forgotten, even promises we've made and the effort you put in",
  "where are you? the one who will shine light on my darkness",
  "I don't want to miss you like this",
  "can I go back to a small airship that's out of orbit and lost its signal?",
  "but never forget, even in the hopeless abyss, we can do things different. we can do it our way, our own way",
  "come on, get out, work out some more, babe",
  "even if my vision blurs, there\u2019s no hesitation now",
  "where are you? the one who will embrace my weary self?",
  "you gotta chase nobody",
  "in this vast universe, where is the place for me to rest?",
  "and so it is. the problem is with me. I'm the one who needs to go.",
  "oh you, you have a story that only I know",
  "it's all over, without a word. all the painful memories.",
  "that's a waste of time. no pain, no gain? disagree"
