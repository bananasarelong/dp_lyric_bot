  "I'm floating endlessly, my heavy eyes are falling asleep",
  "in this vast universe, where is the place for me to rest?",
  "I know we loved somehow, but I'm never going back",
  "I'm not strong enough to hold you the way I once did",
  "so don't you wanna save me",
  "memories I've built up until now flash by. can I pour them all out here now?",
  "where are you? the one who will shine light on my darkness",
  "don't abandon me. I have nothing when I erase you."
