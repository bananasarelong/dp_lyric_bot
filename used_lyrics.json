  "the path that leads to you comes with a cool breeze and dazzling, clear sunlight",

  "where are you? the one who will shine light on my darkness",
  "and so it is. the problem is with me. I'm the one who needs to go.",

  "we are playing a new sound. at last, here we are, you and I.",
  "baby, please don't cry tonight",
  "I don't want to miss you like this"
