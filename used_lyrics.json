  "oh you, you have a story that only I know",
  "I said that I wanted to do well, but nothing ever goes my way, I guess",
  "we are playing a new sound. at last, here we are, you and I.",

  "so don't you wanna save me",
  "this is how my world became perfect because of you",

  "only honest people suffer here, that's the world we live in",
  "it's all over, without a word. all the painful memories.",
  "memories I've built up until now flash by. can I pour them all out here now?"
