  "can I go back to a small airship that's out of orbit and lost its signal?",
  "if all that's left is ash just let it burn",
  "I know we loved somehow, but I'm never going back",
  "let's burn our whole bodies for the last season, so there's no trace of regret left",
  "in this vast universe, where is the place for me to rest?",
  "baby, please don't cry tonight",
  "even your smile, calm like the sea, I want to look at it every day",
  "so don't you wanna save me",
  "and so it is. the problem is with me. I'm the one who needs to go.",
  "only honest people suffer here, that's the world we live in",
  "where are you? the one who will shine light on my darkness",
  "when today is over, after that shining moment, where should I go?",
  "I'll go back to what it was like without you",
  "I said that I wanted to do well, but nothing ever goes my way, I guess",
  "I know I've forgotten, even promises we've made and the effort you put in",

  "where are you? the one who will embrace my weary self?",
  "memories I've built up until now flash by. can I pour them all out here now?",
  "but never forget, even in the hopeless abyss, we can do things different. we can do it our way, our own way",
  "come on, get out, work out some more, babe",
  "I wish for no more nights crying alone. I wish everything would just go right.",
  "are you really throwing yourself away for people who aren\u2019t even blood?",
  "you gotta chase nobody"
