  "I'm floating endlessly, my heavy eyes are falling asleep",
  "in this vast universe, where is the place for me to rest?",
  "I know we loved somehow, but I'm never going back",
  "I'm not strong enough to hold you the way I once did",
  "so don't you wanna save me",
  "memories I've built up until now flash by. can I pour them all out here now?",
  "where are you? the one who will shine light on my darkness",
  "don't abandon me. I have nothing when I erase you.",
  "if all that's left is ash just let it burn",
  "our today is like the last summer. memories that won't come back",
  "only honest people suffer here, that's the world we live in",
  "we are playing a new sound. at last, here we are, you and I.",
  "I was far away from behaving like somebody that is fine",
  "I know I've forgotten, even promises we've made and the effort you put in",
  "I wish for no more nights crying alone. I wish everything would just go right.",
  "everything has started to disappear",
  "I'll go back to what it was like without you",
  "come on, get out, work out some more, babe",
  "I don't want to miss you like this",
  "oh you, you have a story that only I know",
  "the red light turns on, and everyone holds their breath",
  "it's all over, without a word. all the painful memories.",
  "baby, please don't cry tonight",
  "and so it is. the problem is with me. I'm the one who needs to go.",
  "this is how my world became perfect because of you",
  "are you really throwing yourself away for people who aren\u2019t even blood?",
  "dancing a hot dance on heated sand, our youthful days that won\u2019t stop",
  "you gotta chase nobody",
  "that's a waste of time. no pain, no gain? disagree",
  "I said that I wanted to do well, but nothing ever goes my way, I guess",
  "can I go back to a small airship that's out of orbit and lost its signal?",
  "even your smile, calm like the sea, I want to look at it every day",
  "but never forget, even in the hopeless abyss, we can do things different. we can do it our way, our own way",
  "the path that leads to you comes with a cool breeze and dazzling, clear sunlight"
