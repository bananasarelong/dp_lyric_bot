  "our today is like the last summer. memories that won't come back",
  "but never forget, even in the hopeless abyss, we can do things different. we can do it our way, our own way",
  "dancing a hot dance on heated sand, our youthful days that won\u2019t stop",
  "where are you? the one who will embrace my weary self?",
  "can I go back to a small airship that's out of orbit and lost its signal?",
  "where are you? the one who will shine light on my darkness",
  "are you really throwing yourself away for people who aren\u2019t even blood?",
  "oh you, you have a story that only I know",
  "if all that's left is ash just let it burn",
  "in this vast universe, where is the place for me to rest?",
  "it's all over, without a word. all the painful memories.",
  "baby, please don't cry tonight",
  "let's burn our whole bodies for the last season, so there's no trace of regret left",
  "I know I've forgotten, even promises we've made and the effort you put in",
  "this is how my world became perfect because of you",
  "I said that I wanted to do well, but nothing ever goes my way, I guess",
  "what if I disappear, just like this? what if I evaporate into the sky? without even a single thought, let's sing today's song",
  "come on, get out, work out some more, babe",
  "even if my vision blurs, there\u2019s no hesitation now",
  "don't know what to do when I'm like this",
  "memories I've built up until now flash by. can I pour them all out here now?",
  "that's a waste of time. no pain, no gain? disagree",
  "the red light turns on, and everyone holds their breath",
  "I don't want to miss you like this",
  "I'm floating endlessly, my heavy eyes are falling asleep",
  "don't abandon me. I have nothing when I erase you.",
  "I'll go back to what it was like without you"
