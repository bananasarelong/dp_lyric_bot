  "I'm floating endlessly, my heavy eyes are falling asleep",
  "I know we loved somehow, but I'm never going back",
  "I'm not strong enough to hold you the way I once did",
  "but never forget, even in the hopeless abyss, we can do things different. we can do it our way, our own way",
  "where are you? the one who will shine light on my darkness",
  "and so it is. the problem is with me. I'm the one who needs to go.",
  "memories I've built up until now flash by. can I pour them all out here now?",
  "this is how my world became perfect because of you"
