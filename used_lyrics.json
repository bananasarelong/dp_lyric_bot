  "so don't you wanna save me",
  "oh you, you have a story that only I know",
  "I said that I wanted to do well, but nothing ever goes my way, I guess",
  "even if my vision blurs, there\u2019s no hesitation now",
  "are you really throwing yourself away for people who aren\u2019t even blood?",
  "I wish for no more nights crying alone. I wish everything would just go right.",
  "only honest people suffer here, that's the world we live in",
  "that's a waste of time. no pain, no gain? disagree",
  "what if I disappear, just like this? what if I evaporate into the sky? without even a single thought, let's sing today's song",
  "baby, please don't cry tonight",
  "I'll go back to what it was like without you",
  "it's all over, without a word. all the painful memories.",
  "when today is over, after that shining moment, where should I go?",
  "the red light turns on, and everyone holds their breath",
  "memories I've built up until now flash by. can I pour them all out here now?",
  "don't know what to do when I'm like this",
  "and so it is. the problem is with me. I'm the one who needs to go.",
  "even your smile, calm like the sea, I want to look at it every day",
  "this is how my world became perfect because of you",
  "come on, get out, work out some more, babe",
  "I was far away from behaving like somebody that is fine",
  "but never forget, even in the hopeless abyss, we can do things different. we can do it our way, our own way"
