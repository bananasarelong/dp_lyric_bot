  "what if I disappear, just like this? what if I evaporate into the sky? without even a single thought, let's sing today's song",
  "I'll go back to what it was like without you",
  "where are you? the one who will shine light on my darkness",
  "everything has started to disappear",
  "but never forget, even in the hopeless abyss, we can do things different. we can do it our way, our own way",
  "even your smile, calm like the sea, I want to look at it every day"
